Basically, client-side scripts are placed inside an HTML document. The client-side scripting can be used to layout the content of the web. For example, when a user makes a request through web browser for a webpage to the server, it just sent the HTML and CSS as plain text, and the browser interprets and renders the content of web in the client end (user). Client-side scripting is designed to run as a scripting language which can be executed by web browser. Front end developer is someone who design and develop client side of a website. Generally. he or she works in user interface (UI) of a website. Front end developer must be at least fluent in three different languages i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript whereas, there are several other libraries which can be used for front end development.',
