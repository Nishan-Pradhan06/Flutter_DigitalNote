    "Data communication is the process of using computing and communication technologies to transfer data from one place to another, or between participating parites. Data communication enables the movement of electronic or digital data between two or more network modes, regardless of geographical location, technological medium or data contents.";

String point1 = "1.Simplex";
String point1Explanations =
    "In simplex mode, the commmunication is undirectional, as on a one way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. Keyboard and traditional monitors are both examples of simplex. Keyboard can be only intorduce input, the monitor xan only accept the output. ";

String point2 = '2.Half-Duplex';
String point2Explanations =
    "In Half-Fuplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive is sending, the other can only receive, anmd vice versa. In this mode, the entire capacity of a channel is taken over by whichever of teo deveices is transmittnig at the time. Wakie-Talkie is the best example of half-duplex system.";

    "Half-Duplex A to B or B to A\nFig:- Half-Duplex Communication";

String point3 = '3.Full-Duplex';
String point3Explanations =
    "In the Full-Duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. This mde is like a two way traffic flowing in both directions at the same time. Here, signals going in either direction share the capacity of the link. Telephone network, online chatting are the example of full-duplex.";
String example3 =
    'Transmission in both directions simultaneously \nFig:- Full duplex communication';

    "Hardware resources such as processor, storage devices, printers, scanner etc can be shared among us using computer network. It hepls to minimize the operational cost of an organization. Similarly software can be shared among us within a network.";
